## 1. Identify your research audience

### Q1. Where are you submitting this work?

### Q2. What do they value as a contribution (in the context of your work?)

## 2. Define Class of Problems and Desired Outcomes

### Q3: What are the "class of problems" researchers care about (practically speaking)?

### Q4. What does solving this class of problems look like? What are desired outcomes?


### Q5. What is the practical problem/goal used to instantiate the "class of problems" we care about?

### Q6: For broader impact, why are these classes of problems important?


### Q7: At a very high level, what are needed for making progress on the "class of problems?"


## 3. Existing Approaches and Schools of Thought (Farther Approaches)

### Q8: What is the school of thought or approach to solving this class of problems that is farther from the approach you actually took, or that your research audience cares less about, or doesn't believe to be possible (e.g., for HCI work, this is often the sci-fi / AI / fully automated approach -  but the main point is that this is the approach that you won’t take in your solution)


### Q9: Why does the farther approach (e.g., sci-fi / AI / automated solution) not truly solve the "class of problems" today? What has been explored thus far and why isn't it enough?

## 4. Existing Approaches and Schools of Thought (Closer Approaches)

### Q10: What is the general approach to solving this problem that your research audience cares more about, and believes to be important for solving the "class of problems"?

### Q11: What are the different schools of thoughts or solution approaches explored thus far, within this general approach? 

### Q12: What are the obstacles each of these schools of thoughts or solution approaches, as they stand today, face in solving your "class of problems"?

## 5. Research Question

### Q13: In light of the shortcomings of existing approaches, what is the new understanding that is needed to solve your problem?


### Q14: State this new understanding that is required as a research question.
 
## 6. Conceptual Contribution

### Q15: What is your conceptual approach to solving the "class of problems"?
 
### Q16: What are the implications of what your conceptual approach enables? What’s the new conceptual understanding or breakthrough? 

 
### Q17: What theoretical principles are drawn on to help enable this conceptual approach and answer the research question?

 
### Q18: What is the research argument for why this conceptual approach is effective for solving the "class of problems"? How does it overcome obstacles that existing approaches face?

 
### Q19: How does your system implement/use your conceptual approach to solve your practical problem? Describe how the core characteristics of your design embodies this conceptual approach. 
 
## 7. Technical Contribution

### Q20: What is the new technical needs that enables the conceptual approach?
 
### Q21: What is the technical obstacle that needs to be tackled to fulfill the technical need to realize the concept?

 
### Q22: Have such technical obstacle been tackled by existing systems? Describe the state of the art and why it isn't enough.
 
### Q23: What is your technical contribution?
 
### Q24: What is your argument for why this technical contribution is sufficient for solving the "class of problems"? How does it overcome obstacles facing existing approaches?
 
### Q25: Is the technical solution generalizable to other use cases beyond the specific application?

## 8. Synthesis Tree

# Study Design

## 9. Study Design

### Q27: How will your study contribute to (new) understanding your conceptual approach? In other words, what questions do you have about the conceptual approach that you would like new insights into?

### Q28: How will your study contribute to (new) understanding your technical approach?

### Q29: What are your hypotheses and claims about what you expect of the results, as it relates to your conceptual and technical approach? 

### Q30: How do the measures you are collecting contribute to your understanding of your conceptual and technical approach? Give examples of how results based on your measures would implicate certain understanding of your conceptual/technical approach (e.g., why it works, how it works, when it works). 

### Q31: What can your study, as designed, *not* teach you about your conceptual/technical approach? How severe are these shortcomings and can they be addressed by revising the study design? 

# Findings

## 10. Core Takeaways 

### Q32: Concisely stated, in light of your core findings, what are the core take-aways that highlight what you have learned about your conceptual and technical approach, that someone else can walk away with (the generalizable knowledge)?

### Q33: What are your core takeaways?

## 11. Revised Understanding of Conceptual and Technical Approach 

### Q34: In what ways did the conceptual or technical argument effectively support solving your practical problem? How have you established the usefulness of the conceptual approach on this practical problem?

### Q35: How generalizable is the conceptual or technical approach? In what ways does your takeaways and findings inform questions one may have about how it can be used/extended to solve the class of problems of interest?

### Q36: In what ways did you find the conceptual or technical arguments limiting? What new obstacles to realizing the concept are discovered in applying your conceptual/technical arguments on the practical problem?

### Q37: Which parts of your conceptual approach couldn’t actually be tested with the data you collected?

## 12. Future Work

### Q38: Based on the revised understanding, what new research questions/directions may you pursue on conceptual approaches?

### Q39: Based on the revised understanding, what new research questions/directions may you pursue on technical approaches?

### Q40: Based on the revised understanding, what new research questions/directions may you pursue on the class of problems studied?
