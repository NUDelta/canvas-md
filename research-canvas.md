# Develop practical argument (for all stakeholders)

## Identify a design situation

### Who are the users?

### What are their high level tasks and goals?

## Test whether this is a design problem (i.e. requires a design solution)

### Are users struggling to accomplish their goals (what are their struggles?)

### Are these struggles the result of a design challenge?

### Can the problem already be solved with current technology?

## Describe broader impact

### Who is the practical audience?

### Why do they care (is this problem important?)

### What’s your problem statement? (Does it capture a core tension? Agent wants X but Y)

## Describe desired outcome

### What’s a real example of what a user wants to do? (Concrete user class / scenario)

### What should users do? (And what should happen when they do it?)

## Describe core obstacles

### Where can designs go wrong? What may prevent a user from reaching their goals?

## Describe design intervention

### What are the core characteristics of your design?

## Constructing arguments

### Why would the design work?

|      Design characteristic      |         Facilitated outcome(s)         |            Obstacle(s) addressed            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

## Write the design argument

### What is your conceptual approach to solving the problem?

> Concise one sentence statement of desired outcome, intervention, and why it should work (summarize Q9, Q12, Q13)

### What is your design argument?

## Check your arguments

### Will your design work? Is it novel?

#### Might the design fail due to an unaccounted obstacle? If so, go back to step 5.

#### Do arguments address all the core obstacles? If not, go back to step 6.

#### Are arguments based on literature (e.g., established theory or practical evidence)? If not go back to step 7.

#### Is design very similar to existing system? If similar go back to Q5.

# Build conceptual model

## Formulate interface arguments

### What are interface challenges for realizing your design arguments? 

1. **Problem statement:** 
    
        **Why important:**  

            **Desired outcome:** 

                **Core obstacles:**  

                2. **Problem statement:** 
                    
                        **Why important:**  

                            **Desired outcome:** 

                                **Core obstacles:**  


                                ### What are your interface solutions & arguments?

                                | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

                                ### Does your interface solution work? Apply Q16 to the interface problem. Note all potential issues.

                                - **Might the design fail due to an unaccounted obstacle? If so, go back to step 5.**
                                - **Do arguments address all the core obstacles? If not, go back to step 6.**
